What things did you considered of during the implementation?

The design of the system focuses on making sure that it works correctly no matter how many times a message is processed, handles errors smoothly, can handle large amounts of data, and keeps the data accurate.

I added new table called ProcessedMessages. It tracks the messages that have already been processed and prevents reprocessing of the same message.

Anything was unclear?

No, everything seems clear. The requirements and implementation details were well-defined.
